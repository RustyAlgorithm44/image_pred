1) How can a slide have 0 acceptable patches? This is sus.. A slide should technically have atleast one patch.. Can there be an output to see which are the slides which had no patches? so I can check manually if they are actually completely empty or not.
2) Why is there no confusion matrix image output!?
3) I got the "best_wsi_model.pth", but how can I now use this to predict an entire folder of .svs files, and get the output? Predictions for each slide as an output file, with the prob for both classes.
4) Also, what are level 0 and level 1 magnifications? if these are like "superficial" and "zoomed", then can there be an even more zoomed one too?
