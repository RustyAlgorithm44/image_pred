    MANUAL REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:
    ==========================
    
    1. Navigate to the rejected patches folder:
       rejected_patches
    
    2. For QUICK review, focus on:
       - Patches with 'low_tissue' in filename (might have small tissue regions)
       - Randomly check a few 'white_background' patches to verify
    
    3. To move a patch BACK to accepted folder:
       a. Remove 'REJECTED_reason_' from the filename
       b. Move it to the appropriate folder in 'extracted_patches/'
    
    4. Example:
       Original: REJECTED_low_tissue_0.20_slide1_x100_y200_l0_t0.20_w0.10.png
       New name: slide1_x100_y200_l0_t0.20_w0.10.png
       Move to: extracted_patches/adeno/slide1/level_0/ (or squamous/)
    
    5. Recommended workflow:
       - Review 50-100 random rejected patches
       - Only move back CLEARLY good patches with visible tissue
       - This should take 10-15 minutes
