    WSI PATCH REJECTION REPORT
    ==========================
    
    NOTE: Rejected patch images are NOT saved to conserve disk space.
    A detailed log of all rejected patches, including their metadata and
    rejection reasons, is available in the following file:
    
    'rejected_patches_info.csv'
    
    This CSV file contains the following columns:
    - patch_path: The path where the patch would have been saved.
    - slide_name: The name of the source slide.
    - coordinates: The (x, y, level) coordinates of the patch.
    - tissue_percentage: The detected tissue percentage.
    - white_percentage: The detected white background percentage.
    - rejection_reason: The reason why the patch was rejected.
    
    You can use this CSV file for analysis or to identify slides that
    may require parameter adjustments for patch extraction.
